# capability-assessment-tool

Select, prioritise and develop your organisation's capabilities.

Using the [online editor](https://erikvullings.github.io/capability-assessment-tool), you can create and download your capability model locally.

## Installation instructions,

Assuming you have `node.js` (v14 or later) running, and `pnpm` installed (otherwise, install it using `npm i -g pnpm`), you can go to the `packages/gui` folder and run:

```bash
pnpm i
npm start
```

This will open the browser and display the tool.
